Your choices will either lead you deep into the mature content during the evil playthroughs, or to their reduction as you help those around you.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in a future fictional world, post-WWIII. The characters can either succeed in overcoming their trauma (good endings) or fail and dive deeper into extreme end of their trauma (bad endings).\r\n\r\nThere are no visual depictions of extreme violence or gore (such as high amounts of blood or bones), and the mature subjects are depicted in a non-extreme and non-glorifying way as a storytelling device. The game includes the topics and mentions of death.\r\n\r\nThe sexual content is non-explicit and presented through textual descriptions with imagery, or story implications. There are no explicit sex scenes, outside of what would be expected of a vanilla dating simulation such as dating, kissing, stimulating scenes and light touching.\r\n\r\nDepending on the selected playthrough, the intensity of the content will vary from vanilla (hero-type) content with a lower frequency of violence and corruption behaviors, to the evil playthrough with higher levels of harm, substance abuse, and morally corrupt behavior."

Streamer Mode will censor ANY sex acts, sexual jokes, and obscene references from the game. Fade to Black will censor all sex acts and nudity. FIVE ALARM CHILI will leave everything uncensored. These settings can be selected at character creation and changed at any time.\r\n\r\nThis game contains a TOGGLEABLE OPTION to turn sex-based minigames and nudity on or off. These minigames include narrative-based and realistic sex acts, including but not limited to: full penetration, oral sex, BDSM, consensual acts of roleplayed nonconsent if the player selects this option explicitly, consensual acts of stalking, and supernatural possession. All acts WILL ASK FOR IN-GAME CONSENT via the course of normal gameplay before unlocking this content and can be turned on/off at any time in the Settings menu.\r\n\r\nAll potentially triggering content (here including suicidal mentions, mentions of parental alcohol abuse, and non-sexual slapping) can be adjusted on the game's Settings page. This will remove the content from your game unless unchecked again.\r\n\r\nThis is a game set at a college and contains copious amounts of mentions of drug use and alcohol among adult characters."
