If you are easily offended or just looking for a fun game only, this game is not for you.\r\n\r\nThis game contains scenes of submission, voyeurism, sexcam, sex toys, exhibition, soft BDSM, manipulation, fighting, kidnapping, confinement and sexual drugs.\r\nAll the sex scenes with penetration are consented by the characters.\r\n\r\nIt is above all a story of passionate love with a hard moment at the end. I love happy ending."
