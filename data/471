It is a \u2018point and click\u2019 political thriller with a mystery for you to solve, with mild, non-explicit sexual content, characters in skimpy clothing, adult language, and other mature themes. All performers are over the age of 18. The player (equipped with a video camera from the vantage point of their apartment) peers in on the lives of the Hawke family through the windows of Hawke Manor. Experiencing the thrill of the voyeur, the player sits in wait, watching and listening, as the family's twisted affairs unfold. Voyeur combines the suspense of Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\" with an elaborate cast of accomplished Hollywood actors, including Robert Culp, of \"I Spy\" fame in the lead role as Reed Hawke, and Grace Zabriskie, known for her role in \"Twin Peaks\"."
