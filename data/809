Much of this is based on public nudity and popular fetishes. There are scenes of oral and vaginal sex, with the image of the genitals, masturbation scenes, images of sperm, saliva. The orgasm, intimate moments, sexual acts and sexual organs of men and women are depicted in sufficient detail. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou may come across scenes of sexual harassment, groping, near-sexual actions aimed at seducing the character and revealing the plot of the game. But you will not see here violence, sex against someone's will, rape, or criminal acts.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, the plot is built on erotic moments, on excitement, feelings, emotions, and not on pornography or hard porn demonstrations. Porn does not make up the majority of the game, taking up about 10% of the total content. Love relationships, exhibitionism, fetishes, hotwife, voyeurism - this is a linear story with multiple endings. Helping you to step into the role of a husband and sincerely worry about the development of the plot. Only adult characters participate in all scenes; according to the plot, they work after graduating from universities, they are over 30 years old.\r\n\r\nYou will not find in the game scenes of violence, coercion, blood, cruelty, insults or humiliation of anyone, the use or mention of drugs or illegal substances, the mention or participation of younger characters, or more extreme content than is included in the terms - erotica. Have a good time."
