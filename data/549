Aeos will include turning on and off NSFW or just selecting types of adult content events in later updates, especially for RPG lovers looking to play around with others. (Ghost mode. Wooooooo). Currently, the player chooses a character with a pre-disposition to their sexuality and scenes, which currently include m/f and f/f.\r\n\r\nAeos is on the lighter side of the spectrum with how we approach our sexual content. We focus on playing in a vibrant, massive, everchanging virtual world while maintaining frequent NSFW elements; however, corruption branches can put players with certain play styles into more frequent types of sexual content.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, players should expect frequent nudity and deliberate or spontaneous mature content until they familiarize themselves with our game's atmosphere and interactions."
