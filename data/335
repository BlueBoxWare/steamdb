The animations simulate sexual positions, and it is possible to move the camera freely around the scene, having a complete perspective of the sexual act.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing forced in the game. All situations and models were made just to simulate pleasure in a passionate and light way.\r\n\r\nIn Real Girl 3 you will be able to customize the girl, the scene and also walk through a sexual night club, similar to a strip club. Talk to the girls and suggest going to a more private place.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to see in detail the woman's facial expressions and erogenous zones, including her genitalia.\r\n\r\nYou must be 18 years old or over to play Real Girl 3"
