These battlesuits and the scenarios in which they are used are entirely fictitious and are designed to provide a science fiction-themed gaming experience.\r\n\r\nHumanoid Alien Adversaries: A key element of the game's plot is the defense of Earth against an alien race. These aliens are humanoid in appearance and possess the ability to infect human characters, transforming them into aliens. This transformation is a fictitious concept and is integral to the game's storyline and mechanics.\r\n\r\nCooperative Gameplay Elements: Players are encouraged to work together to combat the alien threat. This element of the game focuses on teamwork and tactival gameplay within a fictional setting.\r\n\r\nIsometric Presentation: All content in the game is presented from an isometric viewpoint. This choice of perspective is intentional to reduce immersion into the combat scenes, thereby helping maintain a clear distinction between the game's fictional content and reality.\r\n\r\nParental Guidance: Parents and guardians are recommended to assess the game's content for suitability before allowing minors to play. The rating should be considered to ensure the game aligns with the minors' age and sensitivity to such themes.\r\n\r\nBy providing this note, Stratosphere Games aims to ensure that all potential players are adequately informed about the nature of the game's content. We are committed to responsible gaming and encourage players to consider this information carefully before engaging with the game."
