This would primarily be demonstrated when players use their fists, melee weapons, ranged weapons, or tamed creatures against other players and/or other creatures. Violence may also be demonstrated when wild npc creatures choose to attack player characters and/or other wild or tamed creatures within the game world. Depictions of and reactions to violence (by targeted player character or creature) are not realistically portrayed and the level of blood associated with these acts is mild and limited."

There are horror elements in a fantasy setting and the main character (a detective) uses a gun as well as a fantasy weapon against enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages of the game there is In the earliest minutes of the game you see:\r\nA naked body of a woman, preserved in an ice block, not realistically or explicitly shown. Soon after, a man is shown sitting in a chair smoking marijuana in the first circa 10 minutes, described as being for medicinal use, and legal in Boston (the sequence of smoking is not controlled by the player).\r\n\r\nThere is a bar in the game, where alcohol is served, and the investigation (in the past) centers around a murder case - but the violence is rarely realistic. When violent acts are shown in the adventure sections, it's often in service of the story - and the violent acts are often more alluded to (shown with phantom figures or camera angles disguising the details)."
