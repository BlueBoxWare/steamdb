Crime scenes are graphically depicted with extensive blood-splatter and large amounts of text detail. Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The game also contains sexual material, in still images and text; references to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially exposed breasts and buttocks. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."

Survivors emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.
