To know which chapter contains adult material, look at the chapter selection of each character and find the chapters that say \"Plus\" under the number.\r\n\r\nEvery character in Plus is at least 20+ years of age. All sex is consensual and contains no violence. You can always review the trigger warnings at the start of each new character (chapter 1) to be safe."

These scenes are shown mostly in the epilogue of each character, but some characters have scenes throughout the story that are of sexual nature. To know which chapter contains adult material, look at the chapter selection of each character and find the chapters that say \"Plus\" under the number.\r\n\r\nEvery character in Plus is at least 20+ years of age. All sex is consensual and contains no violence. You can always review the trigger warnings at the start of each new character (chapter 1) to be safe."
