Players engage in Russian roulette to eliminate each other, featuring dramatic gunshot sounds, a tense atmosphere, and elimination animations. There is no realistic blood or graphic violence.\r\nThe game does not include sexual content, drug use, or self-harm. Alcohol may be visually represented in the environment (e.g., bottles on the table) as part of the thematic setting. The game takes place in a dark, mature-themed mafia world."
