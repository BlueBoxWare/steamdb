As such, there are times when, on the hunt for a suspect or chasing a clue, Harrison must make his way into the less reputable areas of Neo Haze. While we won't show use of illegal drugs or explicit scenes of violence or sex, there will be scenes in which Harrison for example enters a bar and characters around him consume alcohol or in which he interrogates a lightly dressed dancer in a strip club. Similarly, the topic of illegal drug business may play a part in a case, though it won't be shown explicitly and will clearly be portrayed as a crime commited by the bad guys. And of course, there will be cartoon portrayals of dead bodies - a crime needs a victim after all. But all you, the players, will see is the aftermath, the crimescene once Harrison arrives, not the act of violence itself. "
