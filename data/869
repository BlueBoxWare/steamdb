But this game doesn't show you that directly. \u201cYou have to listen to them word by word. \"Not the character's tone of voice\" \"Don't judge them personally\" \"Read as many documents as possible\" \"Don't let your emotions cloud your reason\" In GeminiFlame : Alpha Dragon 1.0.0, it will test your logic and your critical thinking. [This game is not a roguelike game. It doesn't have very violent content. But it is dark with its own story. I recommend that people aged 15 and up play this game.]"

These questions often revolve around choices related to superpowers, abilities, and everyday decisions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that we do have a few questions that touch upon more mature topics, such as alcohol consumption and smoking. These questions are intended to simulate real-life dilemmas that people face but are presented in a lighthearted and non-graphic manner.\r\n\r\nUltimately, our goal is to provide a balanced mix of questions that can be enjoyed by a wide range of players, and we always encourage users to skip any questions they may find uncomfortable or unsuitable for their preferences. Your enjoyment and comfort while playing our game is of utmost importance to us."
