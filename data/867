      "notes": "Our game primarily features intense and graphic violence, including scenes of people and monsters being killed. The violence is often depicted in a gory and brutal manner, with blood and body parts prominently displayed in various parts of the game. Since the game focuses heavily on combat and survival aspects, the mature content mainly revolves around these themes.\r\n\r\nThere is a substantial use of gore and blood throughout the game, and players will frequently encounter scenes of characters being injured or killed. This includes not only human characters but also various types of monstrous creatures. The game doesn't shy away from portraying the raw and visceral nature of these violent confrontations.\r\n\r\nDespite the violent nature of the game, there are no depictions or implications of sexual acts or non-consensual sex. The game does not contain any explicit sexual content or nudity. While the game is violent, it does not involve any themes of sexual assault or harassment.\r\n\r\nThe game does not contain any depictions of drug or alcohol abuse, nor does it depict or promote self-harm in any form. The story does not revolve around any substance abuse or self-destructive behavior.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, potential players should be aware that while the game is devoid of sexual content, drug and alcohol abuse, or self-harm themes, it does contain a significant amount of violent and gory content. It is advised that players who are sensitive to these types of content consider this before purchasing the game."
