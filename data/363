Survivors emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.
