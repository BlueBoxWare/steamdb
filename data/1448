You\u2019ll need to avoid this presence while exploring the environment and solving puzzles in order to progress.\r\n\r\nThere is no graphic gore, sexual content, or explicit self-harm depicted in the game. However, the overall tone is intense and may be disturbing for some players, especially those sensitive to themes of isolation, pursuit, and unseen threats.\r\n"
