This combat includes melee weapons, projectiles, and special attacks, but it is not explicitly gory or gratuitous.\r\n\r\nRegarding sensitive topics, our game does not feature depictions of sexual assault/non-consensual sex, drug and alcohol abuse, or self-harm. We have focused on creating a storyline that is rooted in Japanese folklore, honor, and bravery, and have avoided content that could be distressing to players.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing an enjoyable gaming experience that respects the comfort and sensitivities of our players while delivering an engaging and captivating narrative."
