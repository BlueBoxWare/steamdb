It's essential for our community to have a clear understanding of what to expect and to ensure a comfortable gaming experience for all:\r\n\r\nSexual Content: Our horror game does not contain depictions of sexual acts, nor does it touch upon topics of sexual assault or non-consensual sex. The narrative focuses on horror elements that are separate from any sexual themes.\r\n\r\nViolence: The game does contain elements of horror and suspense, which can manifest in intense scenes. However, this is in line with the genre and is not gratuitous. Players should be prepared for tense atmospheres and potentially startling moments, but not graphic violence.\r\n\r\nDrug and Alcohol Abuse: There are no depictions or narratives surrounding drug and alcohol abuse in our game.\r\n\r\nSelf-harm: We have taken care to avoid sensitive topics such as self-harm, and it is not present or implied within our storyline.\r\n\r\nWe urge potential players to consider these points and gauge their comfort level with the content. Our primary goal is to provide a thrilling horror experience without delving into topics that could be triggering for some players.
