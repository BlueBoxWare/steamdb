Slavery (both for sex and labor), Racism, and the sacrifice of mortals are an almost daily occurrence, and the catastrophic war that is the game's subject matter has already claimed thousands of lives. The player can, and likely will, commit actions over the course of a campaign that will lead to the death of entire villages, and perhaps even capital cities, civilians and soldiers alike. Additionally, the concepts of genocide/ethnocide, and ethnic replacement, are some of the driving forces behind the warring factions, as the bitterness between the races that inhabit the Karavi lands has exploded into civil war. Blood and gore are also minor features of the game's art. Although we feel like these concepts enhance the story of Ciel, they are clearly not for everyone. Please consider these factors before purchasing/playing the game."
