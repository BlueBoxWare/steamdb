As players explore an open-world environment, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy camps, mines, forts, and towns, and kill human enemies. Players use bows, guns, and melee weapons to kill enemies in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Dead human and animal bodies can be found around the world. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. The words like \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the game."
