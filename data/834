There is subtext of hypnosis within the stories, regarding the tentacles, that compels the main character to seek them out.\r\n\r\nModerate cartoon-style violence also happens, mostly from tentacle swipes and superhero acrobatics.\r\n\r\nBook covers can be found with and without nudity, all including bondage involving tentacles, some with penetration, body absorption, and/or vore."
