Visually, Yaz features fantasy violence, pervasive absurdly skimpy garments,  and some nudity in the royal baths..\r\n\r\nThe opening cinematic contains still images of sexual activity (no genitals). Sexual acts and and suggestive poses are depicted in the environment art throughout the game. There are plenty of mature themes throughout the game but very little profanity.\r\n\r\nWe would observe that while there is explicit material, the game is more NC-17 than XXX. There is no \"long duration\" or animated sexual content. There is no visible penetration or genitalia. There is not now- nor  shall there ever be- an \"18+ patch\"."
