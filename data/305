Players use an assortment of melee weapons like blades, axes, and ranged weaponry like bows, pistols, shotguns and machine guns to fend off the undead and the living alike. Combat is often close quarters, with blood and gore alongside decapitation and dismemberment as frequent sights. The environment often has dead bodies or blood visible in the area. During combat, the player may impale zombies in their heads and bodies with sharp objects, leaving their damaged corpses behind. The player is often put into moral dilemmas in which they may use violent action against initially non-hostile characters. Foul language and profanity happens frequently in dialogue."
