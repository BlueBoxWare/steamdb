The frenzied combat features instances of intense violence highlighted by frequent gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, blood and gore, and instances of dismemberment and mutilation. Some maps show skinned corpses with partial nudity. One mission chain sees the mercenaries locate and destroy packages of drugs in a cartel compound. Dialogue includes examples of Strong Language. "
