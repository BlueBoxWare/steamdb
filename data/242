As players explore a futuristic alternate universe, they engage in turn-based combat with beasts called Chimera. Characters use sword-gun weapons to deplete enemies' health meters; combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, light effects, and cries of pain. One cutscene contains still images of a character repeatedly shooting another with a pistol; a pool of blood is depicted afterwards. The game includes some suggestive imagery: a beach scene in which female characters are provocatively posed in swimsuits that reveal deep cleavage; a hot-spring sequence in which women appear partially topless. The dialogue briefly mentions illicit drugs (e.g., \u201c[I]llegal, sweetly flavored drugs are popular lately...\u201d and \u201cRecently there have been rumors of drug trafficking...\u201d). The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."
