Crime scenes include victims who have been subjected to scalp removal, crucifixion, dismemberment, and other forms of extreme bodily harm. All violence is described through text and static imagery rather than animated sequences.\r\n\r\nDISTURBING THEMES:\r\nThe game explores dark religious themes, cult worship of a serial killer, and psychological manipulation. The narrative deals with morally complex situations involving death and justice.\r\n\r\nHORROR ELEMENTS:\r\nThe game contains psychological horror elements and disturbing crime scene imagery presented through stylized visual novel format.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION:\r\nWhile visual content is stylized (pixel art/low-poly 3D), the written descriptions and dialogue contain explicit forensic and investigative terminology describing acts of extreme violence.\r\n\r\nThis game is intended for mature audiences only and may be disturbing to some players."
