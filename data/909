Players will encounter:\r\n\r\n- Combat Violence: Engage in battles where enemies are defeated using a variety of weapons. The combat is designed to be impactful but is not excessively gory.\r\n- Blood Effects: Some visual effects include blood particles to convey the intensity of battles.\r\n- Mortality Themes: Players will come across scenes with deceased characters as part of the game's darker narrative, contributing to the atmospheric storytelling.\r\n\r\nWhile the game does feature these mature themes, they are presented in a manner that is not overly graphic or gratuitous. The depiction of violence and death serves the game's storyline and setting, which is rooted in a dark fantasy world. There are no scenes depicting sexual acts, sexual assault/non-consensual sex, drug and alcohol abuse, or self-harm."
