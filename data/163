In fact, there is no adult content at all.\r\nAccording to the laws, games containing scenes of smoking, drinking of alchoholic beverages, usage of mild drugs are prohibited for the children. Our heroes drink wine, smoke hookah (presumably with mild drugs :) ).\r\n\r\nAlso our game contains quite a bit of erotic scenes, scenes of violence and gambling.\r\nWe were arguing in our team about the content rating of the game and decided to set the maximum possible just to avoid possible problems.\r\n\r\nSo, please have in mind: this game is NOT about tits and asses (well, not only about it :) ). This is the game about adventures, with spirit of old movies and books about barbarians, which we love. We tried to create something similar and hopefully we did it :)"
