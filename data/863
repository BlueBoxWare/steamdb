While we do not depict explicit sexual acts or graphic violence, Adaloria does contain some elements that players should be aware of:\r\n\r\nViolence: Adaloria is set in a medieval fantasy world with warring factions and dangerous creatures. There is combat and violence present, but it is not excessively graphic or gratuitous.\r\n\r\nSensitivity to Violence: We do not depict graphic or gratuitous violence, and we do not include depictions of sexual assault, non-consensual sex, drug and alcohol abuse, or self-harm in the game.\r\n\r\nMature Themes: Adaloria does explore mature themes such as political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and the consequences of one's choices. However, we do so without explicit content.\r\n\r\nPlayer Choices: The game's storyline is driven by player choices, and you have the agency to decide how your character interacts with the world. You can choose to engage in morally complex situations or avoid them, as your decisions shape your character's path.\r\n\r\nWe prioritize a respectful and responsible approach to storytelling, ensuring that Adaloria can be enjoyed by a wide audience. If you have any specific concerns about content or would like further clarification, please feel free to contact our support team or refer to our content guidelines. Your enjoyment and comfort in our game are important to us."
