As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.

Survivors emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.
