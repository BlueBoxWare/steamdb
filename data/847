As such, the game contains scenes involving chastity play, erotic humiliation, orgasm denial, use of restraints (bondage), spanking, cuckolding, and blackmail.\r\nSome sexual acts are either non-consensual or involve questionable consent.\r\n\r\nThe game also occasionally depicts the use of alcohol and tobacco.\r\n\r\nAll characters in the game are over the age of 18."
