The themes of the tables are action-packed, and while playing, you\u2019ll encounter gory, scary, or spooky scenes. \r\n\r\nWhile the characters perform violent acts, the game of pinball is still a skill-based game with an established ruleset, and as such the scenes mentioned are short and stay within the clearly defined space of a pinball machine. \r\n\r\nThe game features no sexual content."
