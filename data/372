Victory scenes are graphically depicted with extensive self-harming and large amounts of beer. Winners are frequently depicted with happiness and sometimes sincere frustration, arrogant smiles, or laying on floor. The game also contains references, in animated sequences and text; references to other games. Animated sequences also depict partially exposed hobgoblin female's breasts and buttocks. The words \"\u0442*\u0433\u043e\", \"\u043b*\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\" and \"\u043a*\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\" appear in dialogue."
