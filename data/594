To know which chapter contains adult material, look at the chapter selection of each character and find the chapters that say \"Plus\" under the number.\r\n\r\nEvery character in Plus is at least 20+ years of age. All sex is consensual and contains no violence. You can always review the trigger warnings at the start of each new character (chapter 1) to be safe."

These scenes are shown mostly in the epilogue of each character, but some characters have scenes throughout the story that are of sexual nature. To know which chapter contains adult material, look at the chapter selection of each character and find the chapters that say \"Plus\" under the number.\r\n\r\nEvery character in Plus is at least 20+ years of age. All sex is consensual and contains no violence. You can always review the trigger warnings at the start of each new character (chapter 1) to be safe."

Players take on the role of a character immersed in challenging battles and face enemies in a dark, atmospheric environment that may contain scenes of explicit combat and references to social injustices of the time.\r\n\r\nWhile the game explores themes of resilience and justice, it portrays violence in a way that aligns with the historical and narrative context. There are no depictions of sexual abuse, drug or alcohol use, or other explicit sensitive topics."
