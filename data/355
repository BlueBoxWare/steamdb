Players have control over some of Walker's characteristics such as their gender, skills and attire.  \r\n \r\nWalker wields various firearms and tools to fight against enemies, including traditional guns like a shotgun and pistol, the boomerang-like Wingstick and sci-fi weapons like the Grav-Dart Launcher. Over the course of the game, players will acquire new skills and abilities, like Overdrive, which significantly increases the power and effectiveness of their attacks, Shatter, which pushes back enemies, and Slam, which propels Walker in the air before slamming down onto enemies, dealing damage and throwing them back.  \r\n \r\nEnemies in RAGE 2 consist of different types of human bandits, human-sized mutants, cyborg mutants and enormous super mutants.  \r\n \r\nRAGE 2 also features vehicular combat and racing, with the player being able to drive any vehicle in the game world.
