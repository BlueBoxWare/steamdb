There is swearing in the game, but it's mostly \"translated\" into parody medieval English.\r\n\r\nThere are also scenes of comedic nudity and implied sexuality, as well as 2D cartoon violence, similar to drunken boxing and kicking. Please, do not try to recreate any of this foolishness at home, or anywhere for that matter. Just enjoy the silliness. Thank you."
